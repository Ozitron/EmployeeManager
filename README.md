## Getting Started

## Needs to be improved (added)

- **Update existing employee records**: The ability to update existing employee records is currently missing 

- **MVVM pattern**: The MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) pattern, while present, could be improved for better separation of concerns and maintainability

- **View names**: The naming conventions for views could be more descriptive

- **Unit tests**: Unit tests for the application's functionality will be added
